# Roni's Challenge
### By Sam Yao and Karlo Flores

## Problem Statement
Roni's Mac Bar in College Station is looking for insights into business trends to anwer questions about customer behavior. We have developed a business facing dashboard that shows insights into trends and gives key performance metrics so that the business can make data-driven decisions to grow their business.


## Setup
To utilize our dashboard, one must have access to PowerBI on a windows machine. Simply open up the file in PowerBI and the dashboard should be accessible


## Explanation
On Page 1, there are two charts and a KPI title card for Most Sold Item. The Pie Chart breaks down sales by category (such as drinks, noodles/Noods, sauces, etc.). Every Selection was grouped by their categorization choice based upon the Roni's online ordering menu. Additional groups were created for potential further analysis such as requests. The second chart has a breakdown of Average Sales by Day of the Week. This chart also breaks down the average number of toppings sold per day.

On Page 2, A bar chart was created to showcase sales per month. The bar chart also has a breakdown of menu items sold that month, such as Mac, Grilled Cheese, or Party Items. Included is a 'Mix' category, which is assumed to be a subset of Mac and Cheese.

Page 3 shows two time charts and two slicers which show the sales over opening hours, as well as a history of all sales. The slicer allows users to select menu items to find out if certain items are popular at certain times.


## Insights
- We found it hilarious that Roni's sold the most number of items in their history on 4/20.
- Finals week is another point of high sales.
- The most ordered drink is water.
- Many people ask for their drizzle on the side.
- The most popular Bowl, based upon most commonly ordered items, is A Cheddar Regular Mac Bowl with BBQ Sauce, Pulled Pork, and Broccoli.
- A sizeable number of people per month order their mac and cheese to be mixed. This trend correlates with the start of the new semester, perhaps this is new students ordering their bowls mixed.


## Potential Actions
- Roni's could do some sort of promotion on 4/20 and/or finals week.
- Based upon the most popularly ordered items, the previously mentioned bowl could be promoted as a ready-to-order menu item.

## Future Work
- Add a chart showing change in percentage of sales per month, which can be broken down by item
-
